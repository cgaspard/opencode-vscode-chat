/**
 * The self-healing policy, expressed as a pure decision function so the timing
 * loop in the bridge stays a thin shell and the reliability rules are covered
 * by unit tests.
 *
 * Two failure modes drive everything:
 *   1. LM Studio itself is unreachable (show the offline banner, wait for it).
 *   2. LM Studio is up but the OpenCode server died / we lost our client
 *      (silently restart + reconnect, with backoff so we don't hammer it).
 *
 * A third state sits between them: the probe *timed out*. A saturated server
 * (mid-generation) answers slowly but isn't gone, so timeouts only flip us
 * offline after a consecutive streak — one slow probe must never pop the
 * offline banner during a long generation (issue #7).
